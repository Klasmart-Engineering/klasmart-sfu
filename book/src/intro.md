# Introduction

KidsLoop Live is complex service that composes multiple services together to provide a unique integrated online learning experience.  These documents will serve to orient and specify the Audio/Visual component of the KidsLoop Live experience.  

Most scheduled KidsLoop Live sessions serve teachers and students together.  These sessions can be one-on-one tutoring sessions, small classes of one teacher and a dozen students, or large classes with multiple teachers and dozens of students.  

This document serves as both an onboarding guide and a reference, so feel free to read chapters independently or out of order.  There is an index at the end to mark the locations where each term is used in any degree of detail.
